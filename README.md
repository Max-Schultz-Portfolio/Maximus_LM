# Maximus_LM
In one of my courses at Boston University, my professor underscored the fact that we really don't know what goes into the creation of common functions in R. Occasionally, we get results from these functions that have complicated interpretations as a byproduct of design. This occurrence prompted us students to design our own version of the common 'lm' function. Take a look at what this function can handle... it is truly marvelous. While it is by no means optimized, it serves as a solid stepping stone for future design.

# Maximus_LM
In one of my courses at Boston University, my professor underscored the fact that we really don't know what goes into the creation of common functions in R. Occasionally, we get results from these functions that have complicated interpretations as a result of function design. This occurrence prompted us students to design our own 'lm' function.
